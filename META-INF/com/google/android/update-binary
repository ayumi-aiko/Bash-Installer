# the current zip installer and the stdout.
# to fix compatibility, we need to give the installer another variable to map to the
# actual stdout of the installer, previously it was /proc/self/fd/1 but now it's something else
# small edit, /proc/self/fd/1 didn't work on older versions but it did work on magisk and newer twrp bases

# unpack language and put it in /dev/tmp/common.eternal so that the installer can take variables
# from it and use the value to print it in the UI
# but first, we need to get the current UI language and extract the file based on the language
# if we dont have translations, just extract english and proceed.
# but unfortunately, we can't get the actual language with getprop ro.product.locale,
# so im gonna use the log to figure the current language out.
# the situation here is that the language mentioned twice is the current language
# jesus christ (not a christian but i love jesus)
